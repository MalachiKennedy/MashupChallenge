<h1>My Pets:</h1> <!--Title I chose.-->
    
<p>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</p>
    
<h3>Lula the Dog</h3> <!--The first pet-->

<p>Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with.  I like to take her to the park.  Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.</p>
    
<h3>Slowpoke the Turtle</h3> <!--The second pet-->

<p>Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.</p>

<h3>Hamster the Fish</h3> <!--The third pet-->

<p>Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
